# Dependencies

There are a few tools to create this project. Below you will find a list of all the dependencies we use and what they are used for.

## Material UI

[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) is used to create the Grid system on the dashboard page. This helps create a responsive design that works on all devices.

## Shoelace

Shoelace is used for several components, such as buttons, inputs and more. Read more about [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/).

### Why shoelace?

Honestly, just because it most closely resembled the design we were going for. It's also very easy to use and has a lot of components.

## Chart.js

[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) is used to create the bar chart on the dashboard page.

## React Router

[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used to create the navigation on the dashboard page.

## Sass

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is used to create the styles for the dashboard page.

### Why Sass?

Sass is a very powerful tool for creating styles. It allows you to create variables, mixins and more. It also allows you to nest styles, which makes it easier to read.

While we do not use all the features of Sass, it is just a good tool to have in your toolbox when needed.

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is used to create a visual representation of all the components. This makes it easier to see how the components look and how they are used for other developers.
