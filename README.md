# ShoppingListApp

A shopping list app that you can run at home on your own server.

## Why was this project created?

This project was created as a way to deal with a problem that I have. I have tried many different apps and websites to keep track of my shopping list, but I have never found one that I really like. So I decided to create my own. With shared items and stores between users but personal shopping lists.

This making it easier to create shopping lists with your partner or roommates, but still have your own personal shopping list. Help each other keep track of stores and their items, but still have your own personal items.

## What is the goal of this project?

The goal of this project is primarily to learn but also create a useful app for myself and others and to also give developers the power to edit and update the app to their liking, and in turn running it on their own server at home.

Do not have dev experience? No problem! I will try to make it as easy as possible to get this app running on your device.
