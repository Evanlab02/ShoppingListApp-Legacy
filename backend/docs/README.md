# Shopping app backend

This is the backend of the project. It is a REST API written in Python using the django framework.

We use django along with django-ninja to create a REST API. The API is documented using OpenAPI and the documentation is available at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) when running the backend locally.
